# MREN-178-Project
Project Created MREN 178 Data Structures and Algorithms. System shows a multi communication protocol network used to communicate over wireless microcontrollers.
The goal of the project was to demonstrate the use of data structures learned in class. I choose to implement linked-list based queues to store incoming and outgoing packets.
